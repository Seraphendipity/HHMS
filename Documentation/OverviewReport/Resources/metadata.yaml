  The idea behind the senior design project through EE-498 and 499 is to 
  demonstrate the ability to design, model, and eventually create a prototype 
  of the chosen team project. Throughout this project, the team develops a 
  further understanding of teamwork regarding communication and delegation. 
  The idea behind this project is to develop a home health monitoring system 
  controller that has the ability to connect multiple subsystems to approach 
  different aspects of a client's needs. This was done by designing the 
  systems hub around the goal of creating a modular system that would fit 
  around a clientâ€™s flexible needs. The design process consisted of creating 
  a design table that would display all design decisions made throughout the 
  process of creating the system. To ensure the best choices were made 
  throughout the design process, each decision table was created to display 
  and ultimately choose the best decision for each part of the design process. 
  In each decision table, numerous weighted engineering characteristics were 
  used to calculate the chosen option. These decision tables were compiled to 
  create the design table used to create the prototype.
